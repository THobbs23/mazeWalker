# mazeWalker
AI maze solver

This program utilizes breadth first and depth first search to solve a 10x10 maze read in from a text file.

After solving the maze, the program displays the path taken from the entrance along the path to the exit in the form of coordinates.

In the text file, the entrance is signified with 'E', paths as 'P', walls as 'W', and the exit as 'X'.
The entrance must be on the left wall, and the exit can be on any wall, as long as there is a path to it from the entrance.

Two of the text files used to test the program are included in the repository.
